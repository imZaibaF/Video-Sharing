# Video-Sharing

Project: Video-Sharing using PHP/MySQLi
Create a sophisticated video platform encompassing user authentication, video upload functionality, and a feature-rich video player.

About
The Video Sharing Website is a basic PHP/MySQLi project that enables users to upload videos for online public sharing. The well-known and highly popular video-sharing website YouTube (YT) served as the inspiration for this project. With this method, the user needs to register in order to upload and distribute a movie or videos. After posting a movie or clip to the website, users should go to the "My Uploads" page, which displays a list of all the videos they have posted. After that, the user only needs to click the "Upload" button located in the top right corner of the page's container to bring up the user-friendly upload form.
When a user selects a video to upload, a preview area appears on the right side of the upload modal. It should be noted that the selected video is not immediately uploaded to the website; instead, it must be submitted by the user by clicking the "Upload" button on the modal. For the video to play, the user can also upload a poster or thumbnail image. In addition, this project keeps track of how many times each user clip has been seen by other users or website visitors.
